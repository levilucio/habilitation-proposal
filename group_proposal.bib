abstract="Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are used for improving many facets of software development, but whether and to what extent this aim is achieved is an important issue that must be addressed. This paper presents a proposal for a Framework for Qualitative Assessment of DSLs (FQAD). FQAD is used for determining the perspective of the evaluator, understanding the goal of the assessment and selecting fundamental DSL quality characteristics to guide the evaluator in the process. This framework adapts and integrates the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard, CMMI maturity level evaluation approach and the scaling approach used in DESMET into a perspective-based assessment. A detailed list of domain-specific language quality characteristics is elaborated, and a novel assessment method is proposed. Two case studies through which FQAD is matured and evaluated are reported. The case studies have shown that stakeholders find the FQAD process beneficial.",

We conducted a survey amongst developers that use this DSL while developing applications for customers. The DSL has been used in about 30 projects all around the world.",

pages="276--304",
abstract="Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are often argued to have a simpler notation than general-purpose languages (GPLs), since the notation is adapted to the specific problem domain. Consequently, the impact of domain relevance on the creation of the problem representation is believed to improve programmers' efficiency and accuracy when using DSLs compared with using similar solutions like application libraries in GPLs. Most of the common beliefs have been based upon qualitative conclusions drawn by developers. Rather than implementing the same problem in a DSL and in a GPL and comparing the efficiency and accuracy of each approach, developers often compare the implementation of a new program in a DSL to their previous experiences implementing similar programs in GPLs. Such a conclusion may or may not be valid. This paper takes a more skeptical approach to acceptance of those beliefs. By reporting on a family of three empirical studies comparing DSLs and GPLs in different domains. The results of the studies showed that when using a DSL, developers are more accurate and more efficient in program comprehension than when using a GPL. These results validate some of the long- held beliefs of the DSL community that until now were only supported by anecdotal evidence.",

abstract="Domain-specific languages (DSLs) assist a software developer (or end-user) in writing a program using idioms that are similar to the abstractions found in a specific problem domain. Indeed, the enhanced software productivity and reliability benefits that have been reported from DSL usage are hard to ignore and DSLs are flourishing. However, tool support for DSLs is lacking when compared to the capabilities provided for standard General-Purpose Languages (GPLs). For example, support for unit testing of a DSL program, as well as DSL debuggers, are rare. A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) has been performed to better understand the DSL research field, identify research trends, and any possible open issues. In this talk I will first introduce DSLs by discussing when and how to develop DSLs, then results from SMS will be presented along with open DSL problems such as lacking tool support for DSLs and difficulties in combining DSLs.",
